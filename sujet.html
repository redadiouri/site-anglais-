    <h1>Medical Technology: France vs USA</h1>

    <!-- 1. Introduction -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Medical technology is the use of modern tools to help people stay healthy or to treat diseases. It includes machines like X-rays, MRI scanners, surgical robots, and digital solutions like mobile apps, wearable devices, and telemedicine.
      </p>
      <p>
        In today's world, medical technology is growing fast and becoming a key part of healthcare. It helps doctors diagnose faster, operate more safely, and monitor patients even from a distance. In this project, we compare the use of medical technology in France and the United Statesâ€”two countries with different healthcare systems but strong innovation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 2. Technological Advancements -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Technological Advancements</h2>
      <p>
        Both France and the USA use advanced medical tools, but their approaches are different. France focuses on improving public access to tech, while the USA leads in private innovation.
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>France</th>
          <th>USA</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Apps like Doctolib for appointments and video calls</td>
          <td>Leaders in telehealth platforms like Teladoc Health</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>High-tech hospitals with MRI, CT scans, surgical robots</td>
          <td>AI used to detect diseases (e.g. cancer diagnosis with machine learning)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>National investment in health data platforms</td>
          <td>Private companies drive innovation and smart health devices</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <!-- 3. Laws and Ethics -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Laws and Ethics</h2>
      <p>
        Health data is sensitive. Each country has different laws to protect patients. France is strict and slow to adopt, while the US is flexible but sometimes risky.
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>France</th>
          <th>USA</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Protected by GDPR (strong European privacy law)</td>
          <td>Protected by HIPAA (Health Insurance law)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Strict data control and slow validation of new tools</td>
          <td>Faster approval of innovations but more data leaks reported</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Government agencies regulate health tech</td>
          <td>More freedom for private companies</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <!-- 4. Accessibility -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Accessibility for Patients</h2>
      <p>
        Access to technology depends on the healthcare system. France provides public healthcare, while the USA is mostly private.
      </p>
      <p>
        In France, medical technology is usually covered by national insurance. Most people can benefit without extra costs. In the USA, high-tech services can be expensive, and not everyone is covered by insurance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 5. Challenges -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Even with great technologies, both countries face important challenges:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Protecting patient data from hackers and misuse</li>
        <li>Training doctors and nurses to use new systems</li>
        <li>High cost of equipment and updates</li>
        <li>Ensuring access for rural and poor communities</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- 6. Conclusion -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Medical technology is improving healthcare around the world. France and the USA show different ways to use innovation. France focuses on access and security. The USA moves faster and creates new tools with private companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, both countries can learn from each other: combining strong protection with fast innovation could help more people get better care.
